# Perovskite Evaporation Benchmark
This repository contains all MATLAB and Simulink scripts developed for the data-driven modeling and predictive control of perovskite deposition. In addition to the implementation files, the repository provides the Excel datasets with six experimental samples of PbI₂ deposition at a rate of 0.5 Å/s:

Scripts must be runned according to the following workflow:
